# Markdown Test

I am curious to see if Notion will pick up on the markdown from this txt file.

My Goals (for this project):

* Exercise my markdown muscle.
* Exercise my vim muscle.
* Go back to watching iOS vibe coding to stellar MRR yt video.

Result: it worked!! They only problem is that to copy text from this file, I have to open it in nano (or another text editor) and copy from there.
