Does the pull request provide a separate feature to merge or once i approve a pr, it merges automatically to the main 
branch? Let's find out. I will create this present document. I will then checkout a new branch called approve-andor-merge. I 
will add the next steps to this document from that branch. Au revoir! === Awesome, I am on the approve-andor-merge branch 
now, having deleted *4m-*-main* branch. I now will save this file as the two current sentences are more than enough to ... 
wait. I need to commit first from the main branch this file. Otherwise, I will just push a new file from this branch. I will 
be back : I am checking out main, committing, and coming back
